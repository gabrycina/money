## What is Money?
Money is a rational game based on social economy concepts, inspired by [Five YouTubers. Five games.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJSI7QTAt_o) 
a prize game created by the famous youtuber Tom Scott. Our version of the game works with 4 players, each of whom will also have a superpower that can be 
used once per game to gain different advantages.

## How to install
### Java
You need to [install](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) java to run the backend of our game, we use the jdk 19 version.
